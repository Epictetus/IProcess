## Barney

Barney tries to make the sharing of data between processes as easy and **natural** as possible.  
This library is *highly* experimental right now.

## Limitations

* Behind the scenes, Barney is using Marshal to serialize ruby objects, and therefore suffers from
  the downfalls of Marshal itself. Proc objects, Binding objects, Anonymous classes, 
  and Anonymous modules, cannot be shared.

* Barney is not thread-safe. I plan to change this in the future.

## Examples

Okay, now that we've got that out of the way, let's see what using Barney is like.

    #!/usr/bin/env ruby

    extend Barney::Share
    share :a

    a = 1

    shared_fork do 
        a = 2
    end

    puts a # 2


The API is definitely not set in stone, and a stable release won't be made for a while.
