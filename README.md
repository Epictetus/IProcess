Barney makes sharing data between processes easy and natural by providing a simple and easy to use DSL.  
Barney is supported on any Ruby implementation that supports 1.8.7+, 1.9.1+, and that implements `Kernel.fork`.

Underneath the hood, Barney is using `Marshal` (the module) to serialize objects and send them across pipes created by `IO.pipe`.  
If an object can't be serialized by `Marshal`, it can't be shared.  That means objects such as anonymous modules, 
anonymous classes, and Proc objects can't be shared by Barney.

Below is an example of how simple it is to use Barney, but please take the time to look at 
[The Wiki](https://github.com/robgleeson/barney/wiki) if you're interested in Barney, because I cover other APIs 
and everything else in much more depth.

Usage
-----

    #!/usr/bin/env ruby
    require 'barney'
    
    Barney do
      name = "Robert"
      share :name

      fork do
        name.slice! 3..5
      end

      p name # "Rob"
    end
