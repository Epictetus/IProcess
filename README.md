 ![Barney Picture](http://i.imgur.com/VblLQ.png)

Barney makes sharing data between processes easy and natural by providing a simple and easy to use DSL.  
Barney is supported on any Ruby implementation that supports 1.8.7+, 1.9.1+, and that implements `Kernel.fork`.

Limitations  
-----------

* Sharable objects  
  Behind the scenes, Barney is using Marshal to send data between processes.   
  Any object that can be dumped through Marshal.dump can be shared.  
  This excludes anonymous modules, anonymous classes, Proc objects, and possibly some other objects I cannot think of.

* Thread safety  
  Barney is thread-safe as long as one instance of Barney::Share is used per-thread.  
  There is a mutex lock in place, but it only concerns Barney::Share#synchronize, where data is shared among all 
  instances of Barney::Share.

Usage
-----

__Magic "Barney" method__

    #!/usr/bin/env ruby
    #
    # Magic "Barney" method

    require 'barney'

    Barney do
      name = "Robert"
      share :name

      fork do
        name.slice! 3..5
      end
    end

    p name # "Rob"

 __Barney module__

    #!/usr/bin/env ruby
    #
    # Barney module sample
    # Messages are forwarded onto a single instance of Barney::Share.
    
    require 'barney'

    Barney.share :name
    
    Barney.fork do 
      name.slice! 3..5
    end

    Barney.wait_all
    Barney.sync

    p name # "Rob"

* _More!_  
  Check out the [samples](https://github.com/robgleeson/barney/tree/master/samples) directory.  
  Check out the API docs, too.

* _Notes_  
  The DSL is implemented in _Barney::Share_.  
  You can create instances of(or subclasses) of _Barney::Share_ if you need to.
