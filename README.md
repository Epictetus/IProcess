__DESCRIPTION__

  IProcess, short for _Inter Process Communication(IPC) Process_, is a    
  Domain Specific Language(DSL) that can be used to share Ruby objects     
  between processes on UNIX-like operating systems. The README covers the   
  basics, and there is the API documentation for everything else.

  This project was formerly known as 'Barney'. 

__EXAMPLES__

__1.__

Sequential in nature (each subprocess must finish before another can execute):

    name = "rob"

    IProcess.new do
      share :name
      
      fork do 
        name.capitalize!
      end
    end

    p name # => "Rob"
    
__2.__

A subprocess is spawned 5 times, in parallel:

    workload = IProcess::Job.spawn(5) do
      # Replace this with heavily CPU-bound code ;-) 
      1 + 1
    end

    p workload # [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
