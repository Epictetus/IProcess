Barney makes sharing data between processes easy and natural by providing a simple and easy to use DSL.  
Barney is supported on any Ruby implementation that supports 1.8.7+, 1.9.1+, and that implements `Kernel.fork`.

Underneath the hood, Barney is using `Marshal` (the module) to serialize objects and send them across pipes created by `IO.pipe`.  
If an object can't be serialized by `Marshal`, it can't be shared.  That means objects such as anonymous modules, 
anonymous classes, and Proc objects can't be shared by Barney.

Below is an example of how simple it is to use Barney, but please take the time to look at 
[The Guides](https://github.com/robgleeson/barney/wiki) if you're interested in Barney, because I cover other APIs 
and everything else in much more depth.

Usage
-----

The two main components of the DSL are the Barney method, and the Jobs method.  
Which one you should use depends on what you want to do, but I'll show you an example of both. :)  


_The Barney method_  
The Barney method executes each subprocess sequentially so shared data from the first subprocess is available to the next subprocess.  
It is especially useful if you want to perform some operation that should be restricted to a separate address space, but be able to share the result 
of that operation with the parent process.

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require 'barney'

Barney do
  name = "Robert"
  share :name

  fork do
    name.slice! 3..5
  end

  p name # "Rob"
end
```

_The Jobs method_  
The Jobs method is especially designed for running multiple jobs in parallel.  
The passed block is executed in one or more subprocesses, with the return value of each subprocess returned to you in an Array.

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require 'barney' 

number  = 21
results = Jobs(3) { number + number }
p results # [42, 42, 42]
```
